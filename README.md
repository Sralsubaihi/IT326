Project Motivation:

Strokes are a major global health concern, ranking among the leading causes of death and long-term disability.
With significant societal and economic consequences, understanding the factors contributing to stroke risk is essential for effective prevention and early intervention. This project aims to leverage the Stroke Dataset to analyze key risk factors such as age, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle habits. By uncovering these insights, we hope to facilitate early diagnosis, promote awareness, and support evidence-based decision-making. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to reducing the burden of strokes and improving public health outcomes through data-driven solutions.
